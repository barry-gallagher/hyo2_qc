QC Tools assist in the review of various types of data occurring all throughout the ping-to-public process.

Accepted data inputs are bathymetric grids, feature files, sounding selections, and directory structures.
The output is GIS-layers that alert to the user various parts of their data that might require more attention.
Summary reports are also printed for the record and review.

The objectives are to improve data accuracy, while also reducing the overall time required for ping-to-chart.
