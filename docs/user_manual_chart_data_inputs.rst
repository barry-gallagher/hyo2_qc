    single: data; clear

In **Data outputs:**

* The output **Formats** may be customized. The user has the option to suppress **Shapefile** and **KML** output.

* Output files location is controlled by the **Create project folder** and **Per-tool sub-folder** flags. The four available combinations are:

  * No flags set (see :numref:`chart_folder_structure`, pane A). The outputs are stored directly under the default or user-defined location.
  * Only the **Per-tool sub-folders** flag set (see :numref:`chart_folder_structure`, pane B). The outputs are stored in a tool-specific sub-folder (in the default or user defined-location).
  * Only the **Create project folder** flag set (see :numref:`chart_folder_structure`, pane C). The outputs are stored in a survey folder (in the default or user defined-location). *This is the default setting.*
  * Both flags set (see :numref:`chart_folder_structure`, pane D). The outputs are stored in tool-specific sub-folders in a survey folder (in the default or user defined-location).

* The default output **Folder** location is listed; however, this may be modified via drag-and-drop (or browse to) a user-specified output folder. To return to the default output folder location, click **Use default**.

* The ensuing functions will open the output folder automatically upon execution;  however, if needed, the specified output folder may be accessed by clicking the **Open folder** button.
