    single: chart review

The **Chart Review** tab will:

* Ingest a bathymetric grid, sounding selections, and feature files (see :ref:`chart-data-inputs-label`).

* Truncate grid elevation to decimetric precision (see :ref:`grid-truncate-label`).

* Export grid elevation as ASCII XYZ file (see :ref:`grid-xyz-label`).

* Truncate all "z" values in an S57 file to decimetric precision (see :ref:`s57-truncate-label`).

* Scan HCell features to ensure proper attribution (see :ref:`chart-scan-features-label`).

* Evaluate chart-scale soundings and features versus survey-scale soundings via "triangle rule" (see :ref:`chart-triangle-rule-label`).
